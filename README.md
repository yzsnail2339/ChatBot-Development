## 💡 Developer Reflection

This project was developed using [Botpress](https://botpress.com/), integrating various features such as tables, knowledge bases, web search, and autonomous nodes. Key reflections include:

- **Learning Curve:** Initial tutorials were outdated; actual implementation required hands-on trial and error.
- **Documentation Gaps:** Lacking resources for advanced features like variable access, AI task cards, and autonomous nodes.
- **Successes:** Website search and table-based budgeting worked well with customization.
- **Challenges:** Variable access syntax inconsistency, limited AI card flexibility, and autonomous node instability.
- **Improvements Wanted:**
  - Better documentation and onboarding for new users
  - Custom LLM training for tourism domain
  - Feedback-based learning and emotional conversation capabilities
  - Visual and editable itinerary presentation formats
